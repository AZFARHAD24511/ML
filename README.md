## 🧠 Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is the study of algorithms that improve their performance at tasks through experience. Common supervised ML tasks include:

- **Classification** (e.g., predicting credit approval from the `bank-additional.csv` dataset)  
- **Regression** (e.g., forecasting numerical outcomes)  
- **Clustering** (e.g., segmenting customers based on behavior)  

This repository’s `ML/` folder contains:
- An overview of classic algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.)  
- Example code and notes on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

## 🤖 Deep Learning (DL)

Deep Learning leverages multi-layer neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of data. Key advantages include:

- Automatic feature extraction  
- High capacity for complex, unstructured data (images, text, audio)  
- State-of-the-art performance in many domains  

The `DeepLearning/` folder currently holds:
- **deep_learning_models.md** – conceptual notes on neural network architectures  
- Plans for Jupyter notebooks and training scripts for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and more.

## 🚀 Streamlit Apps

We’re building interactive demos to visualize models and interpret their outputs:

- **import_streamlit_app.py** – App scaffold to load and test different ML/DL models  
- **streamlit_shap_app.py** – Demonstration of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability  
- Future apps will include live dashboards for real-time inference and performance monitoring.

## 🔧 Under Development

This repository is **actively being developed**. Planned enhancements include:

- **Implementation of advanced architectures** such as LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models for time-series and NLP tasks  
- **Hyperparameter tuning pipelines** (Optuna, Hyperopt)  
- **Model versioning & CI/CD** integration for automated testing and deployment  
- **Docker & Dev Container** support for reproducible environments  
- **Deployment** to cloud platforms (e.g., Streamlit Cloud, AWS SageMaker, or Azure ML)

Stay tuned as we flesh out these components and deliver end-to-end ML/DL solutions—from data ingestion and model training to interpretability and production deployment!
